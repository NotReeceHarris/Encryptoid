### // Details

This is a collection of encryption algorithms I created to learn more about encryption. I used a variety of techniques and skills to create encoding and decoding programmes and would **NOT** recommend using any of them to encrypt sensitive data because they were created by a junior cyber security researcher, not a professional!

Encryption type, encryption name, and security rating are all controlled by [me](https://github.com/NotReeceHarris) and are made up and should not be taken at face value. All content is decided and published as my personal opinion.
